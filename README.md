**Top Three Elves' Calories**

This Java program is designed to help Santa's Elves on their annual expedition to the jungle to gather star fruit, which provides the magical energy required for delivering presents on Christmas. The Elves need to ensure they have enough calories to stay energized during their journey. The task is to determine the total calories carried by the top three Elves who have the most calories.

**Prerequisites**
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
**Usage**
1. **Input Data:**
Create a text file (e.g., "input.txt") with the calorie inventory of the Elves. Each Elf's inventory should be separated by a blank line. For example:
   1000
   2000
   3000

    4000
    
    5000
    6000
    
    7000
    8000
    9000
    
    10000
2. **Compile the Java Code:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you have saved the Java code ("TopThreeElvesCalories.java"), and compile it using the following command:
   
  `javac TopThreeElvesCalories.java`

3. **Run the Program:**

   After successful compilation, run the program with the following command, providing the input file as an argument:
   
    `java TopThreeElvesCalories input.txt`

4. **Output:**

   The program will display the total calories carried by the top three Elves with the most calories. For example:

**Example**
An example input file ("input.txt") and the corresponding output are provided in this repository to help you understand how the program works.
